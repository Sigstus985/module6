This is all I've managed to muster up for the module. I have a (somewhat) functional front end that can pull data from mongoDB on the users request. I've started working on implementing HTTP verbs in the function so the user can edit, create, or delete entries on the database. Although that work is not finished.
I've taken some measures to make sure the website is accessible: I've made sure to keep the color scheme high-contrast for users with visual disabilities. This in combination with keeping font-size on a reasonable level ensures everyone has an easy time reading the text on the website. The website is also fully tabable, no mouse is required to access the full functionality of the page. For SEO I did my very best to give HTML-elements relevant names that corresponded to the service the website is offering.
